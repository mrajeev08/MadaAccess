# MadaAccess
Estimating access to post-exposure prophylaxis in Madagascar

For now: just scripts + pipeline!

Data + output not tracked until end of project

Then summary data/anonymized data tracked and pushed up, but other data maintained locally onlyOnly final code generated output (in full) pushed up to repo (and non-heavy things!)
