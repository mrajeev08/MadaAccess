## S1. Estimating travel times to the nearest ARMC

We used two raster inputs: 1) the travel time estimates generated using
the friction surface from the Malaria Atlas Project (Weiss et al. 2018)
at an ~1 km^2 scale and the locations of existing ARMC and 2) the
population estimates which we resampled from the World Pop raster of
population originally at an N resolution. We then extracted the mean of
travel times weighted by the population in that grid cell for each
district or commune to get administrative level estimates of travel
times to the nearest ARMC. Figure S1 shows the raster inputs as well as
the resulting estimates of travel times at the admin level.

## S3. Candidate models of bite incidence

## S4. Sensitivity of these models to reporting/contact cut\_offs

## S5. Incrementally adding clinics (where they were added, shifts in ttimes + catchment pops, shifts in burden/reporting etc. –answer q here: why are there still abt 100 deaths)

## S6. Sensitivity of burden estimates to parameter assumptions (baseline + incremental)
