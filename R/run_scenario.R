## Calculate incremental decrease
## Run in parallel (should only take apprx 50 min or so)

## 1. Read in ordered ctar

## for i in 32:nrow(ctars)
## calculate ttimes
## summarize by commune + district using shapefile rasterized data 

## append to dataframe and output

## estimate burden @ district and commune level

## calculate max + min # of bites on avg + p_rabid + expected bite incidence by ttimes + get mean deaths
## (also do it stochastically?)

## test to see if this gets you about the right # as the stochastic sims?
