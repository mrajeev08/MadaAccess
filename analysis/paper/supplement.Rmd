## S2. Estimating bite incidence 
Vial demand was simulated under simplified assumptions of PEP administration and adherence [@rajeevHealthcareUtilizationProvisioning2019], based on patients reported randomly across the year. During this period, the Thai Red Cross Intradermal regimen was used across Madagascar, with 0.2 mL administered per patient completing doses on days 0, 3, 7, and 28. Vials can be shared within a day between two patients, resulting in 0.1ml wastage per vial shared, plus any additional wastage from unused doses discarded at the end of the day. We estimate vial estimates as the midpoint estimate if all patients complete 3 vs. 4 doses. As clinic submission of forms was highly variable from 2014-2017 (Fig S2.2A), we compared estimated demand to the total vials provisioned across this four year period comparing different thresholds for correcting for periods of no form submission (i.e, designating periods of 1, 5, 10, 15, and 30 consecutive days with zero submitted records as missing, compared to no correction).

Estimates of vial demand based on uncorrected bite patient numbers were generally lower than the number of vials provisioned for those clinics with substantial under-submission of forms (Fig S2.2B). Correcting patient numbers for under-submission resulted in estimates of vial demand closer to the provisioned vials for most clinics  (Fig S2.2C, Table S2.1).

## S3. Modeling reported bite incidence
We used a weakly informative prior for the intercept of the models centered around the mean of the bite incidence for the given dataset with a standard deviation of 10. For the covariate terms, we centered the priors around zero with a standard deviation of 10. For the variance terms ($\sigma_0$ and $\sigma_e$), we set uniform priors ($unif(0, 5)$). We calculated the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC, a metric of model fit to data) for each candidate model as well as the maximum potential scale reduction factors (psrf) for each covariate and the multivariate psrf for the whole model (both are metrics of model convergence, where values < 1.1 are indicative of convergence, Table S3.1) [@gelman2006data].

To test how well our models predicted the data, we sampled parameter estimates from the posterior distribution for each model to generate predictions to compare to data. In addition, we used the models to predict out-of-fit data (i.e. estimates from models fitted to the national data were used to predict the Moramanga data, and estimates from models fitted to the Moramanga data were used to predict the national data). Finally, to check how correcting for incomplete submission of forms affected our modeling results, we fitted our final models to the raw data uncorrected for submission (i.e. assuming forms were completely reported resulting in lower estimates of bite incidence) and with a lower cut-off (7 days, resulting in higher estimates of under-submission of forms).

### *Fig S5.8. Shifts in where bites are reported to as clinics are added for the district model.*
*The circles show the clinic locations for each scenario, with size proportional to the annual average bites reported to that clinic. Lines show where the bites are reported from (commune centroid) also proportional to the number of bites. The polygon shading shows the district level reported bite incidence.*
